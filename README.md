# 1.1 Business Problem
Syria Telcom seek to predict whether their customers will soon leave the company and shift to a different telco. High customer churn rates directly impact the revenue and profitability of telecommunications companies. Therefore, understanding the factors that contribute to churn  would allow Syria telco to take proactive measures, such as targeted marketing, loyalty programs, or customer service improvements, to retain customers.
# 1.2 Objectives
- Develop a Predictive Model for Custmer Churn: The primary objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning classifier that predicts whether a customer will soon stop doing business with SyriaTel. The predictive capability of the model will minimize customer loss and stabilize the customer base hence reducing revenue loss.
- Drivers of Customer Churn: Second goal is to identify the factors that would result into high customer churn.
- Analyze Churn Trends across Different States: The last objective of this project if to examine churn trends across different states to better understand which states are likely to have high churn rates.
